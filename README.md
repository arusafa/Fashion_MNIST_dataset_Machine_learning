- The objective of this project is to build and train a neural network to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. This dataset consists of grayscale images of fashion items, such as T-shirts, trousers, and dresses, and is intended as a drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. The project involves multiple steps including data loading, preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.

- Technology Stack Used:

    - Python: The primary programming language used for this project.
    - Keras with TensorFlow backend: For building and training the neural network model.
    - Matplotlib: For visualizing the images and the model's performance.
    - Jupyter Notebook: For organizing and running the code in an interactive environment.
